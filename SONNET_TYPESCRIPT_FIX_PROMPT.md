# Task: Fix All TypeScript Compiler Errors in Wallet Module

## Context
You are working on the OmniBazaar/Wallet module. The codebase has ESLint violations mostly fixed, but there are numerous TypeScript compiler errors preventing the code from building. These are NOT style issues - they are actual compilation errors.

## Your Mission
Fix ALL TypeScript compiler errors in the entire `/mnt/c/Users/rickc/OmniBazaar/Wallet/src` directory and subdirectories. Work systematically and autonomously without asking for user input. Work alphabetically through the sub-directories and files.

## Critical Instructions

1. **Check TypeScript Errors First**

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/rickc/OmniBazaar/Wallet
   npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -E "error TS" | head -50
   ```

2. **Common Error Types to Fix**
   - **TS2308**: Module export ambiguity - Same type exported from multiple modules
   - **TS2305**: Module has no exported member
   - **TS2307**: Cannot find module
   - **TS2339**: Property does not exist on type
   - **TS2345**: Argument type mismatch
   - **TS2322**: Type assignment error
   - **TS7006**: Parameter implicitly has 'any' type

3. **Fix Strategy by Error Type**

   **For TS2308 (Export Ambiguity):**
   - Replace `export *` with specific named exports
   - Use aliases: `export { Type as ModuleType }`
   - Choose one canonical source for each type

   **For TS2305 (Missing Export):**
   - Check if the export name is correct (case-sensitive)
   - Verify the module actually exports that member
   - Add the missing export if needed

   **For TS2307 (Cannot Find Module):**
   - Check import paths are correct
   - Ensure file extensions are not included in imports
   - Verify the module exists

   **For TS2339 (Property Does Not Exist):**
   - Add missing property to interface/type
   - Fix typos in property names
   - Add proper type assertions if needed

4. **Working Order**
   - Fix `src/index.ts` first (main entry point)
   - Then fix in this order: types → utils → database → api → services → engines → avalanche → client
   - Fix index.ts files in each directory before other files

5. **Rules**
   - NEVER use `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`
   - NEVER use `any` or `unknown` type to bypass errors. Find the actual type from the context in the file.
   - NEVER stub, mock, or leave code incomplete with a "TODO" message in an implementation file
   - NEVER comment out a function or missing dependency just to get the compiler to compile. Fix the actual issue.
   - NEVER add or remove any files
   - NEVER remove any functionality
   - ALWAYS look for and fix any instances you find of stubs, mocks, or incomplete "TODO" in the code
   - ALWAYS add proper types
   - MAINTAIN existing ESLint compliance
   - ADD imports as needed
   - CREATE missing types if necessary

6. **Validation After Each Major Fix**

   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"
   ```

   The goal is to get this to 0.

7. **When Creating New Types**
   - Put shared types in `src/types/` directory
   - Follow existing naming conventions
   - Add JSDoc documentation
   - Export from appropriate index.ts

8. **For Complex Issues**
   - If a type is used in multiple places, create it in the most logical shared location
   - If fixing one error creates others, fix those too
   - If an import cycle is detected, refactor to break the cycle

9. **Progress Tracking**
   - After fixing each file, run tsc to check remaining errors
   - Commit after each major directory is complete
   - Keep track of types you create or move

10. **Final Validation**
    When you think you're done:

    ```bash
    cd /mnt/c/Users/rickc/OmniBazaar/Wallet
    npx tsc --noEmit
    npx eslint src --ext .ts
    ```

    Both commands should complete with no errors.

## Start Now
Begin by checking current TypeScript errors, then systematically fix them starting with src/index.ts. Work autonomously, make decisions based on the patterns you see in the codebase, and don't stop until all TypeScript compiler errors are resolved.

Remember: This is about fixing actual TypeScript compilation errors, not ESLint style issues. Focus on making the code compile successfully.
